19/11:
- got libigl example project working
- tweaked example project to my needs; cmake + xcode working together smoothly
- can load obj-mesh and launch viewer
- collect informative sources on ICP-variants. find good test-case meshes.

1/12:
- had problems getting the nanogui-viewer working. linking problems. fixed it
- learned it's due on the 12th so reprioritizing this, doing other things

6/12:
- wrote out the main meat of the icp algorithm. everything went smoothly
- first results looking good.

7/12
- realized that what I wrote yesterday didn't work after all.. spent the whole
day bug-hunting. Decided to structurally refactor the entire project. Project is
now object-oriented. still needs some cleaning but getting better.
- finally found that the problem was in computing point correspondences! diamond
and moon models now align nicely. bunny does not find global minimum. I think
rejecting pairs/weighting will remedy this.. will try tomorrow!
