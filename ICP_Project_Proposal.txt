Project Proposal for CPSC524

Title: Point Set Registration using ICP

Goal: To write a working implementation of some variant of ICP for aligning two point-clouds using the libigl library. Many classic papers to help me along the way. 

Extra: There are many variants of the algorithm, and many ways to extend a basic working implementation if time permits.
  - store the meshes in k-d trees for faster runtime
  - experiment with different loss-funtions/regularizers
  - write a very tiny "paper" (log) commenting what I have done and summarizing and comparing results

Secondary goal: to focus on writing "good" C++ codeâ€”follow the libigl style-guides and use UnitTests++

Rough plan: have basic components working by end of November, work on extras/extensions until due date December 12th.
